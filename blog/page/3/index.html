  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m pretty busy in these days and unfortunately there&rsquo;s not much time to write blogposts. In detail there&rsquo;s currently a long list of feature wishes and bugs for TemplaVoila which need my attention and in addition I also already started to prepare a workshop for the <a href="http://t3dd10.typo3.org/">T3DD10</a> about Git*.</p>

<p>Just to keep this blog alive this is what I found interesting during the last weeks:</p>

<p>For TYPO3 enthusiasts especially the changes within the TYPO3 Core regarding the integration of further T3UX09 results and all the small changes which happen to get 4.4 ready might be of the biggest interest (<a href="https://svn.typo3.org/TYPO3v4/Core/trunk/ChangeLog">https://svn.typo3.org/TYPO3v4/Core/trunk/ChangeLog</a>). Besides that Sebastian Kurfürst tweeted that he finished the last chapter of his Extbase/Fluid book and Amazon says that they deliver it in the first weeks of July. I think once his book is out we&rsquo;ll see much more people starting to work with Extbase and Fluid.
It also seems that the TYPO3 v5 project &mdash; called &ldquo;Phoenix&rdquo; &mdash; is getting more and more relevant. They decided to <a href="http://news.typo3.org/news/article/scrumify-phoenix/">scrumify the delvelopment</a> and started to do Sprints to achieve quick and visible results. Sounds like a good way to go &ndash; let&rsquo;s see how long they keep that up. Besides that there&rsquo;s also an interesting mail Robert Lemke posted in a newsgroup to answer the rumors about the why v5 takes so long and why they had to start from scratch and so on &ndash; <a href="http://lists.typo3.org/pipermail/typo3-dev/2010-April/039958.html">very interesting statements</a>.</p>

<p>Besides that you might like these bits and bytes:</p>

<hr />

<p>*If anyone wants to help with the Git workshop or has suggestions feel free to contact me. I don&rsquo;t feel really prepared for it yet but I also think that someone has to present Git to the TYPO3 community since Subversion kinda sucks in certain aspects &ndash; also the workshop itself is not confirmed yet but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it will happen since lot&rsquo;s of people are interested to hear about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nearly a month after version 3.0.5, we published 3.1.0 of the well known crawler extension today. The main work for that step was related to several bugfixes, a better scheduler integration, some CLI-API enhancements, better testcases and (finally) some documentation updates. Most kudos go to Michael Klapper who took over the responsibility for this release and who also fixed a decent amount of bugs.
You can download the extension in the <a href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/crawler/current/">TER </a> and hopefully this time OpenOffice didn&rsquo;t trick us again and you&rsquo;ll be able to see a shiny new extension manual on typo3.org as well.</p>

<p>Besides that, Kasper just released the podcast with me talking about version 3.0 of the crawler and about further improvements for the staticpub extension. You&rsquo;ll find that on <a href="http://typo3.org/podcasts/kasper">typo3.org/podcasts/kasper</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday the 2nd team release of TemplaVoila was uploaded into the <a href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/templavoila/current/">TER</a>. It&rsquo;s basically a maintenance release which fixes more than 100 bugs. But since we haven&rsquo;t been that straight distinguishing between bug and usability feature, you&rsquo;ll see a couple of new things within this release.</p>

<p>The high level release notes are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>page module is now customizable with CSS and JavaScript</p></li>
<li><p>handling of static data structures are improved and fully working now</p></li>
<li><p>wizards are improved, new page wizard is more explaining</p></li>
<li><p>visual cleanups</p></li>
<li><p>new hooks for eTypes (elements added by mapping interface)</p></li>
<li><p>new classes for preview in page module, easy to override by extensions</p></li>
<li><p>added missing localisations</p></li>
<li><p>enhanced drag-and-drop in page module</p></li>
<li><p>over 100 Bugs are fixed</p></li>
<li><p>updated manual</p></li>
</ul>


<p>During the installation your TYPO3 Extension Manager will ask to perform a couple of database upgrades. These upgrades aren&rsquo;t really critical because they just enlarge some database fields, which will make sure that your data really fit&rsquo;s in.</p>

<p>Just to point one thing out &ndash; especially the page module has been improved to be more flexible in certain parts.</p>

<p>These lines of TSConfig can be used to add CSS or JavaScript into the page module and enable easy customizations:</p>

<pre><code>mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1.stylesheet = ../fileadmin/css/tvpagemodule.css

mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1.javascript {
  file1 = ../fileadmin/templates/js/jquery.js
  file2 = ../fileadmin/templates/css/backend.js
}
</code></pre>

<p> Further customizations is provided using the &ldquo;<strong>mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1.blindIcons</strong>&rdquo; configuration or with individual content preview classes (configured though &ldquo;<strong>$GLOBALS[&lsquo;TYPO3_CONF_VARS&rsquo;][&lsquo;EXTCONF&rsquo;][&lsquo;templavoila&rsquo;][&lsquo;mod1&rsquo;][&lsquo;renderPreviewContent&rsquo;]</strong>&rdquo; &ndash; see ext_localconf.php).</p>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t discussed what the direction for the next versions really looks like. From my perspective better TYPO3 integration, some kind of code cleanup and also the integration of some features which arise with TYPO3 4.4 will be somehow on our schedule. But since <a href="http://blog.tolleiv.de/2010/03/re-farewell-templavoila/">TemplaVoila isn&rsquo;t a one man show anymore</a>, this isn&rsquo;t just my decision and in addition I&rsquo;d like to encourage everyone to send feedback, bugfixes or new features just to give us an impression what you like or dislike in the current version.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I&rsquo;d like to thank everyone who was somehow involved in the release, especially Steffen Kamper who shared lot of inspiration and who has spent many hours to debug and fix some really tricky issues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dmitry decided to leave the TemplaVoilà project today and he handed the extension-leadership to me. Since this is a very abrupt change and since there was lot&rsquo;s of (mis)communication involved I&rsquo;d like to use this blogpost to answer his <a href="http://dmitry-dulepov.com/article/farewell-templavoila.html">&ldquo;Farewell, TemplaVoila!&rdquo;</a> post (he turned off the commenting function).</p>

<p>As you might know Steffen Kamper and I joined the TemplaVoilà team some time ago and since Dmitry wasn&rsquo;t very motivated to maintain the extension anymore, we took over and tried to make TemplaVoilà ready for TYPO3 4.3 <em>(see Dmitry&rsquo;s clarification below)</em>. We also tried to get rid of the over 250 listed bugs from bugs.typo3.org. This went fine for quite some time and we released version 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 in November parallel to TYPO3 4.3. Unfortunately the release come a little too fast for us and a couple of major bugs couldn&rsquo;t be fixed by that time. After that release we had a meeting with Dmitry and we all agreed to release 1.4.2 in the beginning of January. We found and fixed tons of bugs and also implemented long awaited features in the meantime. We also had the luck that others found new motivation and started to send feedback and started to test TemplaVoilà with us. (Special thanks to Uschi, Jeff and Ron).
Three weeks ago we decided that the current state is &ldquo;ready to release&rdquo; and we told Dmitry that it&rsquo;s up to him to release 1.4.2. Quite some time passed by and today he used several channels (Twitter, Facebook and Newsgroups) to tell the world what he found:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>No TV 1.4.2 release soon. Found a bug in page module with unlinking in 1 minute after starting tests. I am severely disappointed by this :(</em></p></blockquote>

<p>He was right &ndash; a very obvious bug showed up in the page-module within TYPO3 4.2. Unfortunately nobody saw it and it also seems that some of us are still unable to reproduce it. Anyways &mdash;&ndash; in my opinion &mdash;&ndash; he choose the wrong way to communicate that. Instead of talking to Steffen and me, he decided to talk to anyone else. I wrote him a mail and told him that I didn&rsquo;t like the way he brought this up and asked for a Skype meeting to discuss how to proceed. After serveral emails back and forth and after others joined the communication, Dmitry decided (without anyone of us asking for it) to leave the team and hand over the leadership. To make it clear to everyone: the discussion started because of one JavaScript error and a few icons in the backend which he didn&rsquo;t like very much. The Skype meeting never happend &ndash; although it would have saved lot&rsquo;s of time and confusion for all of us.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not very happy with his decision, because this leaves lot&rsquo;s of questions and because we loose a very diligent developer. But it seems that there&rsquo;s currently no way to convince him that he might be wrong.</p>

<p>As team Steffen and I will try to continue the development and improvement of TemplaVoilà, especially because it&rsquo;s one of the most important benefits TYPO3 can offer. I ask everyone to join and contribute some time for testing or feedback. I dislike Dmitry&rsquo;s approach to fork TemplaVoila and host it somewhere else <em>(see Dmitry&rsquo;s clarification below)</em>. I&rsquo;m inviting him to rejoin the team at any time and work in a constructive way with us. I&rsquo;m still convinced that all this just happend because miscommunication and not because of &ldquo;real&rdquo; issues.</p>

<hr />

<p>In addition it also seems that others offended Dmitry and asked him <em>not to stop the process anymore</em> &ndash; I understand his distraction. He did a very good job in the past, he was open for our improvements and his biggest concern was quality not power or money or anything. Being offended for something you do in your freetime without any payment and being offended by people, who earn money from their clients with your (free) work, is always distracting. Please think about that in future communications with any open source software developer.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you wonder how to get in touch with us: <a href="http://bugs.typo3.org">http://bugs.typo3.org</a> lists all known bugs and their status. Report new bugs there or try to add new information to existing ones. Team discussion, in regards to fixed bugs or new features, happens, compareable to the <a href="http://typo3.org/teams/core/core-mailinglist-rules/">TYPO3 Core</a>, in the &ldquo;typo3.team.templavoila&rdquo; list on &ldquo;lists.typo3.org&rdquo;.

<hr />

<ul>
<li>Update 05.03.2010: After I posted that the link to that blogpost on Facebook, Dmitry commented it and just to be fair, that&rsquo;s what he said:</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><em>Thanks for your post. It is fair and explains the situation well. I would only clarify two moments: (1) I am not forking TV but creating a version for myself. I do not plan to release it to TER or anywhere. It is a TV for me as personally I like it (2) &ldquo;Dmitry wasn’t very motivated to maintain the extension anymore&rdquo; is not exactly so, rather to my taste TV already did all it had to do. I invited others to move TV further because I did not need anything else from it. Thanks again.</em></p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>TYPO3 is (by definition) a powerful tool when it comes to data. Besides creating, updating and deleting data there are also localizing and versioning, logging and even rollbacks. All this is provided through the GUI of TYPO3 and all the technical stuff in working under the hood of TYPO3 for nearly every piece of data. But what if you&rsquo;re asked to write a script which imports or updates data, how can you make sure that all this is done in a TYPO3 compatible way?</p>

<p>The lazy programmers approach is to write up SQL, but that&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s recommended if you still want the full TYPO3 featureset to be available for you (without reinventing the wheel). In this case the TYPO3 core class tslib_tcemain (short tcemain) is what you&rsquo;re looking for. For the mentioned tasks there are two main functions relevant &ndash; <strong>process_cmdmap()</strong> and <strong>process_datamap()</strong>. The <strong>process_cmdmap()</strong> performs actions like &ldquo;move&rdquo;, &ldquo;copy&rdquo;, &ldquo;localize&rdquo;, &ldquo;version&rdquo; (create, stage, swap, flush), &ldquo;delete&rdquo; and &ldquo;undelete&rdquo;. The <strong>process_datamap()</strong> does the rest &ndash; creating records, updating datafields. Controlling both of them is done with configuration arrays and that&rsquo;s how it looks like**:</p>

<p><strong>Creating a record*: </strong></p>

<pre><code>$data = array();
$data['tt_content']['NEW'] = array(
    'pid' =&gt; 100,
    'header' =&gt; 'A new thing'
);

$tce = t3lib_div::makeInstance ('t3lib_TCEmain');
$tce-&gt;start ($data, array());
$tce-&gt;process_datamap ();

echo "The new element has the uid ".$tce-&gt;substNEWwithIDs['NEW'];
</code></pre>

<p>Creates a new tt_content record on page 100 with the header set to &ldquo;A new thing&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Updating data*:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$data = array();
$data['tt_content']['110'] = array(
    'header' =&gt; 'A really new thing'
);

$tce = t3lib_div::makeInstance ('t3lib_TCEmain');
$tce-&gt;start ($data, array());
$tce-&gt;process_datamap ();
</code></pre>

<p>Updates the header field of the content element with the uid 110 to &ldquo;A really new thing&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Move data from one page to another*:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$cmd = array();
$cmd['tt_content']['110']['move'] = 101;

$tce = t3lib_div::makeInstance ('t3lib_TCEmain');
$tce-&gt;start (array(), $cmd);
$tce-&gt;process_cmdmap ();
</code></pre>

<p>Moves the tt_content record with the uid 110 to the page 101.</p>

<p><strong>Copy data from one page to another*:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$cmd = array();
$cmd['tt_content']['110']['copy'] = 101;

$tce = t3lib_div::makeInstance ('t3lib_TCEmain');
$tce-&gt;start (array(), $cmd);
$tce-&gt;process_cmdmap ();
</code></pre>

<p>Copythe tt_content record with the uid 110 to the page 101.</p>

<p><strong>Localize your record*:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$cmd = array();
$cmd['tt_content']['110']['localize'] = 5;

$tce = t3lib_div::makeInstance ('t3lib_TCEmain');
$tce-&gt;start (array(), $cmd);
$tce-&gt;process_cmdmap ();
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a localization for the language 5 of the tt_content record with uid 110 (assuming that the tt_content record 110 is a default language record).</p>

<p><strong>Delete*:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$cmd = array();
$cmd['tt_content']['110']['delete'] = true;

$tce = t3lib_div::makeInstance ('t3lib_TCEmain');
$tce-&gt;start (array(), $cmd);
$tce-&gt;process_cmdmap ();
</code></pre>

<p>Deletes the tt_content record with the uid 110.</p>

<p><strong>Undelete*:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$cmd = array();
$cmd['tt_content']['110']['undelete'] = true;

$tce = t3lib_div::makeInstance ('t3lib_TCEmain');
$tce-&gt;start (array(), $cmd);
$tce-&gt;process_cmdmap ();
</code></pre>

<p>Restores the tt_content record with the uid 110 &ndash; if it&rsquo;s deleted.</p>

<hr />

<ul>
<li>Running the codes requires a TYPO3 backend context with a logged in backend user who has the right to perform all these actions. In addition tcemain has some configuration options to change the behaviour of the actions, e.g. &ldquo;$enableLogging&rdquo; or &ldquo;$bypassWorkspaceRestrictions&rdquo; &ndash; they come with useful defaults but you might need to change them in certain situations ~ so looking into the code documentation might save you some time.</li>
</ul>


<p>**  I left out the &ldquo;version&rdquo; part since this requires some more explanation than just a few lines of code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quite some time after the 4.3 release of TYPO3, we published the necessary compatibility version of the crawler extension. Besides the compatibility fixes for TYPO3 and also for PHP 5.3 we also included some handy features:</p>

<p>First of all there&rsquo;s now, besides the CLI interface, also a full integration with the scheduler extension, which is available in TYPO3 4.3. This enables to setup crawler runs and manage all crawler releated tasks through the TYPO3 backend.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;crawler_flush&rdquo; interface was added to the CLI (and scheduler). It helps to clean up the crawler queue and enables to remove finished or unfinished entries.</p>

<p>In addition the CLI was cleaned up a little bit and behaves more intuitive in most situations. Also the help pages should now really tell you what options you have.</p>

<p>And last but not least we&rsquo;ve added the possibility to avoid an additional HTTP request and have the crawler rendering the page directly.</p>

<p>Big kudos for their work and their support goes especially to Mick, Fabrizio and Timo from AOE media.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once a month someone is asking because he has issues to get his mod_rewrite rules to do what he want&rsquo;s. Writing the rules and the required RegEx for these rules is quite easy, but Apache still behaves strange every now and then and that&rsquo;s where one of my favorite ways to &ldquo;debug&rdquo; mod_rewrite comes in very handy. And I felt that writing something is better than having a silent blog ;)</p>

<p>The following block is what it&rsquo;s all about. It seems to have it&rsquo;s origin on <a href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum92/5360.htm">WebmasterWorld</a> and <a href="http://www.latenightpc.com/blog/archives/2007/09/05/a-couple-ways-to-debug-mod_rewrite">Rob Russel&rsquo;s Blog</a> and looks basically like this:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !vardump
RewriteRule (.*) http://www.example.com/$1?vardump&amp;reqhost=%{HTTP_HOST} [R=301,L,QSA]
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty easy and quite nice. The first line just prevents recursion, so that you&rsquo;ll be able to see the first redirect and nothing else. The second line is where you can place in every information you&rsquo;d like to check. The [R=301,L,QSA] makes sure that you can debug without interruption. The &ldquo;R=301&rdquo; makes sure the browser doesn&rsquo;t start a second request, but tells him that the location was changed, the &ldquo;QSA&rdquo; makes sure that the querystring isn&rsquo;t lost and the &ldquo;L&rdquo; prevents that your server performs other redirection rules.</p>

<p>As shown the first block already unveils some information and places it into the redirection URL, so you could use it to check what the value of HTTP_HOST is and you also know whether mod_rewrite works or not. This way you can debug every variable mod_rewrite offers and you can check environmental variables and results of the regular expressions.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to know whether a specific RewriteCond is working or not just place it in that block and you&rsquo;ll see if it&rsquo;s still redirecting or not, like this (<a href="http://twitcode.org/Bb">via</a>):</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !vardump
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-Language} ^de.*$
RewriteRule (.*) http://www.example.com/$1?vardump&amp;languageMatchedDE [R=301,L,QSA]
</code></pre>

<p>Checking a regular expression from an RewriteCond looks like this (used on a server with a pretty strange setup for %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}):</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} !vardump
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} ^(.*\/htdocs\/).*$
RewriteRule (.*) http://www.example.com/$1?vardump&amp;reqfilename=%1 [R=301,L,QSA]
</code></pre>

<p>As you see that&rsquo;s a pretty handy way to debug lot&rsquo;s of mod_rewrite stuff, it helped me quite often and I hope it does the same for you :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today the TYPO3 Core Team released version 4.3 (<a href="https://typo3.org/download/release-notes/typo3-43/">release-notes on typo3.org</a>).</p>

<p>Finally the list of improvements is long and the amount of cool new features is outstanding compared to other releases. Imho especially the security and performance-improvements are remarkable as well as the improved usability in the backend. But I guess my favorite improvement is obvious (<a href="https://typo3.org/download/release-notes/typo3-43/#c5642">hint hint</a>) :P</p>

<p>In addition to TYPO3 4.3 a new major version of the tt_news (<a href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/tt_news/current/">ter</a>) extension was released over the weekend (<a href="http://lists.typo3.org/pipermail/typo3-dev/2009-November/037916.html">Rupert Germans announcement on lists.typo3.org</a>) and the already mentioned <a href="http://blog.tolleiv.de/2009/11/templavoila-1-4-released/">release of TemplaVoilà</a> (<a href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/templavoila/current/">ter</a>) was somehow releated as well.</p>

<p>The next TYPO3 release is planned for May 2010&hellip; we&rsquo;ll see if that happens in time ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A new version of  TemplaVoila (<a href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/templavoila/current/">ter</a>) (<a href="http://forge.typo3.org/projects/show/extension-templavoila">forge</a>) has just been released. Besides the great fact that this is the first <strong>team-release</strong> of TemplaVoila, the high-level improvements within the pagemodule (drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop),  the mapping module and the FCE editing forms and besides lot&rsquo;s of bug fixes, there are a few very nice features which make the day-to-day work with TemplaVoila much easier.</p>

<p>The list of things which happend in 1.4 can be seen on bugs.typo3.org (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/yb9wsnk">preselected filter</a>). The following list contain my favorite fixes which happened unter the hood:</p>

<p><strong>1) Delete content within the pagemodule (instead of unlinking)</strong>
By default you will still see the &ldquo;unlink&rdquo; icon within the pagemodule but one small setting within User- or PageTSconfig will show up delete buttons as well. There are two modes:
<em>mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1.enableDeleteIconForLocalElements = 1 _
will show unlink and delete icons for local elements side-by-side
</em>mod.web_txtemplavoilaM1.enableDeleteIconForLocalElements = 2 _
will show the delete icon and hide the unlink icon whenever possible.</p>

<p>Details: <a href="http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6869">http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=6869</a></p>

<p><strong>2) Skip edit screen after a new content element was created</strong>
Especially for container items it&rsquo;s anoying that the TYPO3 edit screen opens up after such an item was created. The setting <em>noEditOnCreation</em><strong> </strong>within the meta configuration part of your datastructure can be used to change that.</p>

<p>Details: <a href="http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=8079">http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=8079</a></p>

<p><strong>3) Hide TemplaVoila field values and cleanup the pagemodule
</strong>Another problem within large projects is a messed up pagemodule. Very often the field data of flexible content elements shows up without any chance to hide it. Use  <em>disableDataPreview<strong> </strong></em>within the meta configuration part of your datastructure to change that.</p>

<p>Details: <a href="http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=11520">http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=11520</a></p>

<p><strong>4) Define default record values</strong>
A proper setup contains good default values. Within datastructures you can define default values for your flexform-fields and from now on TemplaVoila also provides the possibility to define default-values for the fields of the parent record. The &ldquo;default / TCEForms / <fieldname>&rdquo; parts within the meta configuration part of your datastructure does this. Very useful usage for container elemente is:</p>

<p><meta type="array">
<langDisable>1</langDisable>
<default>
<TCEForms>
&lt;sys_language_uid>-1&lt;/sys_language_uid>
</TCEForms>
</default>
</meta></p>

<p>Details: <a href="http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=8759">http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=8759</a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a completly new &ldquo;New content element&rdquo;-wizard which can be configured with PageTSConfig &ndash; this wizard brings some additional feature for default-value configuration. I&rsquo;m going to bring that up in another post soon.</p>

<p><strong>5) sectionCount / sectionPos register in TypoScript
</strong>Rending fields which are nested in sections is not always fun. Expecially when it comes to position detection for the current item. Two new registers try to help in such situtations:</p>

<p>tx_templavoila_pi1.sectionCount holds the overall amount of items within the current section
tx_templavoila_pi1.sectionPos holds the position of the curren titem -starting with 1</p>

<p>Example:
10 = TEXT
10.value = (last item)
10.if.equals.data = register:tx_templavoila_pi1.sectionPos
10.if.value.data = register:tx_templavoila_pi1.sectionCount</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that the newsgroup is a nice tool for the discussion but not to keep track of the actual changes -To get an idea of what actually happend at the code-base usually you might want to look at the ChangeLog. Therefore I had a script which converted the ChangeLog to an atom feed &ndash; a couple of colleagues liked this idea and asked me to publish it &ndash; so here it is: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/TYPO3-CoreTrunkChangelog">http://feeds.feedburner.com/TYPO3-CoreTrunkChangelog</a></p>

<p><em>Update: &ndash; seems that I had small problems generating proper real <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier">UUID</a>s, this is hopefully fixed now&hellip;.</em></p>
