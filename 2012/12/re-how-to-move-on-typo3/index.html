<div class="entry-content"><p>As I wanted to answer <a href="https://twitter.com/robertlemke">Robert&rsquo;s</a> post but didn&rsquo;t like the privacy of our Core-internal list, here&rsquo;s some kind of response to it. Alongside I&rsquo;ll try to explain the current situation and problems a bit***.</p>

<h3>What happend?</h3>

<p>In his post Robert kind of gave up his attempts to establish a TYPO3 product board [1]. The reasons for this are very wide-spread and mainly the various flame-wars in the last year and the very personal attacts brought him to the conclusion to:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>no longer invest my time into setting up or participating in an overall product team</li>
<li>refrain from trying to establish leadership for the TYPO3 project</li>
<li>concentrate on Flow and Neos and invite teams to participate in frequent meetings about it</li>
<li>unsubscribe from the core internal mailing list</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Even thought this shortens his entire mail a bit &ndash; that&rsquo;s the bottom line it comes down to****.</p>

<p>Looking at the recording of the &ldquo;Not-the-product-board&rdquo; [7] meeting from last Tuesday [2] it seems that these steps aren&rsquo;t necessary, as everybody seemed to be happy with the setup. So what&rsquo;s the criticism actually about? Lucky enough I don&rsquo;t have to describe it myself, but can cite an (again internal) response to an earlier mail from one of my fellow Core Team members:</p>

<blockquote><p>Suddenly, when you (Robert) left the steering committee of the T3A because of the
new bodies and bylaws, you realized that there is no more power for you
to decide about things. That&rsquo;s why you brought up the concept of a
product team. It&rsquo;s an attempt to replace the former steering committee,
which has backed up the decisions of the core team in a nice but
undemocratic way.</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to these two standpoints we&rsquo;ve a mixture of opinions and directions in our community and all of them cause quite some irritation [3,4,5]. With all these repeating fights and discussions Robert and (I guess) most of us ask ourselves how the community could avoid the fighting?</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s my opinion:</p>

<h3>What we should avoid</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Closed door meetings and private discussions</strong> &ndash; most of the &ldquo;emotional outbursts&rdquo; we saw where caused when the seemingly final results where presented to the community out of the blue. The fact that Core-internal is still a vivid place is a problem and we all should be abandon it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Working without vision</strong> &ndash; the long holding support (since 2006) for Neos and the nice drive gridelements got from it&rsquo;s fans [9] are two good examples that a vision can move mountains. But we should renew the vision statement and provide roadmaps on how we want to achieve it &ndash; mainly to motivate contributors and to enable collaboration between the teams.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leaders or leader groups</strong> &ndash; other OpenSource products have their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictatorship">benevolent dictator</a> &ndash; this wouldn&rsquo;t work for our community. Their focus will never reach the entire community and in the end their decisions will always cause confusion. Imho Kasper made a great job to bring TYPO3 to life &ndash; but he/we saw that the &ldquo;dictatorship&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t scale in the end [12] and imho Robert&rsquo;s response and the controversy around the product board kind of shows that too.**</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Personal attacks</strong> &ndash; nobody joined the TYPO3 community to fight, so there&rsquo;s no reason to fight back. Within all controversy and disappointment everyone tries to improve TYPO3 in his way [10]</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>What we need</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Diverse groups from all parts of the community</strong> &ndash; there&rsquo;s no other way to capture all ideas and to gather various people from the entire community. As a nice side effect they make the &ldquo;surface&rdquo; of our community much larger and might help to involve new users. Btw. our community manager<a href="https://twitter.com/benvantende"> Ben van&rsquo;t Ende </a>will be happy to help kickstarting and coordinating groups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open meeting protocols and discussions</strong> &ndash; to make sure there&rsquo;s a chance for everyone to catch-up later and to avoid bad surprises as we saw during the rebranding [3] or during the version schema change [6] In both cases small groups of people made major (not necessarily bad) decisions on their own behind closed doors &ndash; the following controversies showed that good intentions can turn out very negative.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clear communication structures in the groups</strong> &ndash; to make sure things are &ldquo;presented&rdquo; appropriately. As see in [6] or in more recent situations [8] things would improve if groups had clear communication-channels. In [6] and [8]. seemingly official messages turned out to be personal attempts instead without actual &ldquo;approval&rdquo; / &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; from the related groups.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rough product roadmaps</strong> &ndash; They should exist to make sure people share a common vision but they should not be too straight to make sure nobody feels too bound to it. They should also exist to enable some kind of measurement. We should be able to ask the Neos or CMS team whether they &ldquo;live&rdquo; along their vision or whether it would be better to adjust it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Constructive honesty</strong> &ndash; people should discuss openly, in a respectful way [11]. Technical doubts and constructive criticism should be allowed, but it should be fair.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>What does that mean for our products?</h3>

<p>Honestly: I don&rsquo;t know. Looking at the current situations with the lists from above: we have tons of groups working in many directions, we have a group that agreed on a common product-vision  (two times) [13], but the group communicates behind closed doors. I&rsquo;m not aware of any Neos or Flow roadmaps, but TYPO3 CMS has at least a (short) roadmap [14]. The Core team doesn&rsquo;t have clear communication structures yet and as shown this raises ton&rsquo;s of confusion. In addition our discussions tend to get very personal. It seems that sth. like a &ldquo;product board&rdquo; could help but&hellip;</p>

<h3>Product board and leadership</h3>

<p>On one hand I don&rsquo;t like the way how the &ldquo;product board&rdquo; was positioned in the beginning &ndash; it should not lead anything or decide anything. On the other hand it&rsquo;s great to have a group of people taking care to formulate a vision. The access to this group should be open to everyone, not just group leaders. Inner-circles, Top-10 groups, leader groups, Core-internal discussions should be avoided and open group-&ldquo;setups&rdquo; should be emphasized.</p>

<p>Hope this made sense?</p>
