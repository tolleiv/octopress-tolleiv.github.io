The last weekend was great, I joined the T3DD in Elmshorn, Germany and meet a lot of interesting people, the beer was cheap and the weather was amazing. So I'm looking forward to the T3CON in autumn...  :)  
  
It also seems that some of the guys got some new spirit - today 4 official and some inofficial bugs in some extensions had been fixed in a very short sequence ... great!
