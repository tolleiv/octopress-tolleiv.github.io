I just found that [Peter](http://www.xing.com/profile/Peter_Niederlag) shares the slides of the Git workshop from the T3DD10 on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/jugglefish/t3dd10-git). Since this 4 hour workshop was - for many reasons - one of my favorites during the T3DD10, I felt that it's worth to mention it. And due to the fact that TYPO3 is moving very fast towards Git it's worth to look at them ;) --- [Open workshop slides](http://www.slideshare.net/jugglefish/t3dd10-git)

Btw. at the beginning I didn't belief that a Git workshop could fill 4 hours - now I don't think that shorter workshops make any sense :P
