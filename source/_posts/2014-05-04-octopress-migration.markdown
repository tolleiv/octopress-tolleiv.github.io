I've finally managed to step away from Wordpress and migrated my blog to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). There were many reasons for me, the main reason was that I didn't want to host it by myself anymore.

The migration itself was guided by some blog posts which helped me a lot to get insights into Octopress:

* [Migrating 40,000 Posts From Wordpress to Octopress](http://zhen.org/blog/migrating-40000-posts-from-wordpress-to-octopress/)
* [Octopress SEO and Disabling the Blog Route](http://learnaholic.me/2012/10/15/octopress-seo-and-disabling-the-blog-route/)
* [Custom Domain With Octopress and Github Pages](http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/04/30/custom-domain-with-octopress-and-github-pages/)
* [Create Custom Rss Feed for Octopress](http://luosky.com/2012/07/24/create-custom-rss-feed-for-octopress/)

Besides that I managed to keep all the old URLs and migrated the comments to Diqus which went pretty smooth with very little configuration.
