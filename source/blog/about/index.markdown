#### About this blog


The title says what this is about ;) - anything I found interesting or which I wanted to point others to. Most of these things are TYPO3 related.


#### About me


I'm a 32 year old OpenSource enthusiast. I used and developed things for TYPO3 since 2004 and started to work with Puppet and Chef in 2011. Since 7 years I'm part of the [AOE](http://aoe.com) team as a Senior developer and DevOps evangelist. Besides that I've studied Â Computer Science at the great [Technical University of Chemnitz](http://www.tu-chemnitz.de).

Get in touch we me on [LinkedIn](http://de.linkedin.com/pub/tolleiv-nietsch/25/a0a/857/en), [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Tolleiv_Nietsch) or [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/people/@/528343772).


#### About my TYPO3 involvement


Besides client-specific work, I maintain several popular TYPO3 extensions ([templavoila](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/templavoila/current/), [languagevisibility](http://forge.typo3.org/projects/show/extension-languagevisibility), [l10nmgr](http://forge.typo3.org/projects/show/extension-l10nmgr), [crawler ](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/crawler/current/) [and others](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/?tx_terfe_pi1[view]=search&no_cache=1&tx_terfe_pi1[sword]=tolleiv) ). In addition I'm part of the workspace-team and every now and then I try to find some free time to create or review Core patches.

Oh and most important - receiving things on my [Amazon wishlist](http://www.amazon.de/registry/wishlist/K48CS8V4DZ4I/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go) makes me very happen ;)

But you know, I've learned something today: You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us. _Kyle Broslovski_
